                <!-- br tag adds line breaks for improved readability-->
                Web applications let users exchange information securely. They also allow businesses to deliver their services to customers remotely. <br>
                Common uses for web applications include online shopping, instant messaging, search and filtering, and social media newsfeeds.<br>
                Web applications are beneficial for a wide variety of reasons, including: <ul>
                    <!-- ul tag creates an unordered (bulleted) list-->
                    <!-- il tag indicates each list item-->
                    <li> Accessibility. Web applications are easily accessed from anywhere using an Internet connection and a web browser. Users in different locations can collaborate and share information or files, making remote work as effective as in-person.</li>
                    <li> Simplicity. End users do not need to download, install, or configure software in order to use a web application.</li>
                    <li> Security. Web applications receive software changes and security updates automatically, so every user always has the most updated version available.</li>
                    <li> Efficiency of design process. Web applications lend themselves well to short, efficient development cycles. Small development teams can work quickly and cost-effectively to deliver a new product or product updates. </li>
                    <li> Scalability. Web apps can quickly onboard new users for growing businesses using their services. From a development standpoint, web apps scale well because it's just a matter of adding more possible throughput in the cloud.</li>
                </ul>

                    Databases are where the information used by a web application is stored.<br>
                    A web application needs to be able to connect to a back end database in order to authenticate users on login, search, submit forms and orders, and much more.
                    Most of the functions of a web application require connections to a database of some kind. <br>
