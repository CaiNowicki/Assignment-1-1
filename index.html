                Web applications let users exchange information securely. They also allow businesses to deliver their services to 
                customers remotely. <br>
                Common use cases for web applications include online shopping, instant messaging, search and filtering, 
                and social media newsfeeds.<br>
                Web applications are beneficial for a wide variety of reasons, including: <ul>
                    <!-- ul tag creates an unordered (bulleted) list-->
                    <!-- il tag indicates each list item-->
                    <li> Accessibility. Web applications are easily accessed from anywhere using an Internet 
                        connection and a web browser. Users in different locations can collaborate and share 
                        information or files, making remote work as effective as in-person.</li>
                    <li> Simplicity. End users do not need to download, install, or configure software in 
                        order to use a web application.</li>
                    <li> Security. Web applications receive software changes and security updates automatically, 
                        so every user always has the most updated version available.</li>
                    <li> Efficiency of design process. Web applications lend themselves well to short, efficient 
                        development cycles. Small development teams can work quickly and cost-effectively to deliver a 
                        new product or product updates. </li>
                    <li> Scalability. Web apps can quickly onboard new users for growing businesses using their 
                        services. From a development standpoint, web apps scale well because it's just a matter of adding 
                        more possible throughput in the cloud.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    
                    Databases are where the information used by a web application is stored.<br>
                    A web application needs to be able to connect to a back end database in order to authenticate users on 
                    login, submit forms and orders, display products, and much more.
                    Most of the functions of a web application require connections to a database of some kind. <br> 
                    Connecting to the database is also when the most risk to the server exists, as it provides the user an opening
                    into the database owned by the operators of the app. This is where security concerns such as SQL injection
                    can occur. When a programmer or designer creates a user interface, they must keep these kinds of security concerns 
                    in mind. </br>
